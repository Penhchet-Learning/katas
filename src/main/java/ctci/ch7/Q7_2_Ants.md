Trangle
-------
P(collision) = 1 - P(miss)
             = 1 - P(all ants walk in the same direction)
             = 1 - P(all ants walk left) - P(all ants walk right)
             = 1 - 0.5^3 - 0.5^3
             = 1 - 2(1/2)^3
             = 1 - 2 * (1/2) * (1/2)^2
             = 1 - 1/4
             = 3/4


Polygon
-------
P(collision) = 1 - P(miss)
             = 1 - P(all ants walk in the same direction)
             = 1 - P(all ants walk left) - P(all ants walk right)
             = 1 - 2(1/2)^n
             = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1)
